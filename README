"thegrid" was a quick project which was created to test HTML5's <canvas>, node.js, and socket.io.

As it stands, socket.io is configured to only work with the "websocket" transport, because any other method of transport is too slow for this kind of webapp.


To get started simply install the dependencies, fill in your host, and start the server
  
    npm install
    node grid-server.js

grid.html, line 70:
    <script src="http://HOST:8080/socket.io/socket.io.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

grid-client.js, line 9:
    HOST_URI: 'http://HOST:8080',

Then open `grid.html` in various browser windows.
