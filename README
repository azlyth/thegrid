"thegrid" was a quick project which was created to test HTML5's <canvas>, node.js, and socket.io.

As it stands, socket.io is configured to only work with the "websocket" transport, because any other method of transport is too slow for this kind of webapp.


To get started simply install the dependencies, 
  
    npm install

change the hosts at,

    grid.html, line 70:
    grid-client.js, line 9:

and start the server

    node grid-server.js


Then open `grid.html` in various browser windows.
